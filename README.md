# DungeonKit

[banner image goes here]

DungeonKit is a boilerplate of sorts for building Mystery Dungeon-style (that is, grid-based and turn-based) rougelike
games with Javascript (via Node and Typescript).

## Documentation

For documentation, check out the `doc` folder.

## Installation

I recommend forking this repository into your own if you want to use DungeonKit to make a game.

Once you've pulled down your forked copy of DungeonKit, do the following steps to get DungeonKit running:

- Install Node.
	- Go to [Node's website](https://nodejs.org) and download the latest version for your OS from there.
	- Make sure to also get NPM (which should get downloaded with Node).
- Install the required Node packages.
	- Install `bower`, `typescript`, `typings`, and `gulp` globally.  To do this, run `npm install -g bower typescript typings gulp`.
	- To install all other required Node modules, simply run `npm install`.
- Install the required Typescript bindings: `typings install`.

## Building

To build DungeonKit, run `gulp`.

## Running

You can run DungeonKit with `./run`.
